# Bible-Bot

In this application we will build a Bible study assistant AI application that includes: getting a prompt from Grounding, one from the vector store then have the AI combine those response and give me a full one.

# Settings for each prompt:
- Temperature for pinecone: 0
- Temperature for grounding: .4 or .7 (lower than one)
- Final prompt: 0.2 or 0.4

Fixing the system prompt of the AI to the way we like it.
